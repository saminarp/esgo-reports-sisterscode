## Athena Hackathon 2022 - PwC Challenge 
## The challenge ❗️❗️❗️
Lack of a comprehensive, engaging reporting tool that makes it easy for companies to see their ESG performance, outline their ESG goals while making decisions and reward people for outlining good ESG goals. 

# ESGO 🌲 ☀️

We created gamified ESG planning and prioritization platform that helps leaders plan and execute their ESG strategies. The reporting feature will be built on blockchain that will use smart contracts to ensure immutability and transparency. Earn rewards as you achieve your ESG micro and macro milestones and exchange them for NFTs. Our platform will have employee learning components too as it is also a part of ESG goals.
